# Numerical Analysis MATH-251(a)

## Course schedule

**Lectures:** Thursdays, 08h15 - 10h00, GC C3 30

**Exercises:** Thursdays, 10h15 - 11h00, INF 3 


## Exercises Format

During the exercise hour, we will often work with Jupyter Notebooks, which we will upload to this repository. You can access them directly on EPFL's Noto server under the link [go.epfl.ch/numerical-analysis-2024](https://go.epfl.ch/numerical-analysis-2024). Due to various issues with Noto, we strongly encourage you setting up Jupyter Notebooks on your own laptops. You can find a detailed guide on how to do this on the course's [Moodle](https://go.epfl.ch/MATH-251_a).

New series are published on **Tuesdays at 08h15**, and the corresponding solutions one week later on **Mondays at 08h15**.
